Hi I'm Brandon Him, a self-taught developer currently living in Philadelphia. I used to be quite active on Github, but a bit absorbed with caring for a tiny human, and enjoying life outside of the metaverse. While I try my best to maintain all of my open-source repositories, all it takes is a star and a follow to give me a little motivation :).

If you are working on some cool stuff, feel free to shoot me an email, and let's connect.

You can catch my shinnagians on [üìπ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCludBg4ol9VgvHzHe-yRUXw).

### Random Specialities
- **Application Integrations / Marketplace Apps** - I've developed several application integrations with large platforms such as Workplace by Facebook, Shopify, Discord, Slack, Cisco Webex, etc
- **Indie Hacker** - I've participated in over a dozen hackathons and won a handful, but more importantly I've built and delivered many consumer applications used by over several thousand users today.
- **Passionate about Design** - Prior to getting into development, I was a free-lance web designer and spent my early adulthood exploring the creative realm.
- **Competitive Speaker** - While rusty today, I've participated in competitive speaking at the regional level in Silicon Valley.
