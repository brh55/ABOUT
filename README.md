Hi I'm Brandon Him, a self-taught developer currently living in Philadelphia. I used to be quite active on Github, but a bit absorbed with caring for a tiny human, and enjoying life outside of the metaverse. While I try my best to maintain all of my open-source repositories, all it takes is a star and a follow to give me a little motivation :).

If you are working on some cool stuff, feel free to shoot me an email, and let's connect.

You can catch my shinnagians on [üìπ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCludBg4ol9VgvHzHe-yRUXw).

### Random Specialities
- **Application Integrations / Marketplace Apps** - I've developed several application integrations with large platforms such as Workplace by Facebook, Shopify, Discord, Slack, Cisco Webex, etc
- **Indie Hacker** - I've participated in over a dozen hackathons and won a handful, but more importantly I've built and delivered many consumer applications used by over several thousand users today.
- **Passionate about Design** - Prior to getting into development, I was a free-lance web designer and spent my early adulthood exploring the creative realm.
- **Competitive Speaker** - While rusty today, I've participated in competitive speaking at the regional level in Silicon Valley.

### Highlights of 2022

- I flew to Bangkok, Thailand and my team member, [Daanish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daanishhusain/) and I represented the USA in the annual APEC Global Hackathon. We created a simple solution to match farmers with businesses owners to collaborate and utilize degraded land for alternative crops. We were selected finalist, and placed 3rd among 20 different teams from all over the world.
